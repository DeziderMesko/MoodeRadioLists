Example is, with other Zones they will call beat 1511 as 511 and beat  2511 as 511.  So what they did was to have the Beatcars in the 15th District use the Station neighborhood name of the 15th District/Austin Station, as their call sign.  Example is if Beat 1511 was calling the Zone or the Zone was call Beat 1511, they use 1511 or Austin 11 and then 511 on the Zone is known as Beat 2511."

Many stations, both terrestrial and internet-based, may feature unsigned artists, but few exclusively play them. NRM Radio brings you the best of what the New England scene has to offer across the entire heavy music spectrum and plays new music first while paying homage to some of the bands who have paved the way over the years. This is what drives us.  This is what makes us New England's Rock and Metal Underground."

Я даже несколько раз испытал реальный страх из-за разных опасных ситуаций на дороге. Ко всему прочему дворники не справлялись. Евгению приходилось постоянно открывать окно и рукой счищать лед. На полпути сломался обогреватель в кабине, мы начали мерзнуть. Просто жесть… Зато эта поездка позволила ощутить реальную жизнь тракиста. Пусть немного, но ощутить по-настоящему. Кстати, я понял, прямо из трака можно вести прямые эфиры на радио, ставить музыку, принимать звонки. Техника даже позволяет делать видеотрансляцию. Так что теперь в моих и, надеюсь, в Божьих тоже вести регулярные прямые эфиры в движении прямо из трака. Мобильная радиостанция на колесах — это круто!"
