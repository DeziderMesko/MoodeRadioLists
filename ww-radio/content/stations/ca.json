The station is currently owned by Golden West Broadcasting. The station played more pop/rock music other than its rival station, CHFM-FM (Lite 95-9), which has since been rebranded to 95.9 Kiss FM as of 2013, but still played soft rock as well as pre-1979 titles. The station's launch in 2007 marked the first time Calgary began having two adult contemporary radio stations on FM."
