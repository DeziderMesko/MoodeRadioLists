         "description" : "Jazz FM 102.2 is a local British radio station focused on jazz, blues and soul music from all over the world. It is owned by GMG Radio and broadcasts since 1990. They once made an experiment and renamed this station into JFM in order to avoid mentioning “jazz”. They hoped to attract additional audience in this way. But this experiment was unsuccessful, so they renamed it again to Jazz FM. Another attempt to make Jazz FM 102.2 commercially more successful was when its managers added more R&B, easy-listening and adult contemporary music during the daytime and shifted jazz to the nighttime. But this experiment was also a failure. Currently the main focus of this radio station is on Jazz greatest hits from all over the world. But they also play blues and soul music."

The station first went on air in June 1964, long before commercial radio became part of everyday life in Britain. This was made possible because the Isle of Man has internal self-government: it is a Crown Dependency and is not part of the United Kingdom. But Manx Radio did need a licence from the UK authorities and this was eventually agreed to with reluctance, suspicion and not a little alarm. Remember these were the heady days of pirate radio ships anchored just outside the 3 mile limit!"
